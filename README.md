## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, B05576_02_Code.

The code will look like the following:
       
        image: map.pgm
        resolution: 0.050000
        origin: [-50.000000, -50.000000, 0.000000]
        negate: 0
        occupied_thresh: 0.65
        free_thresh: 0.196
